//! Request structures for the Proton Data API.
//!
//! This module provides structures that are used to make requests to the Proton
//! API. These structures are used to define the request bodies and URL
//! parameters that are sent to the API when making a request.
//!
//! The purpose of the API service is to provide not only the means to make
//! requests, but also a formalisation of the data that is sent and received. To
//! this end, the structs in this module should mirror the API endpoint request
//! definitions, and NOT have any business logic or other functionality.
//!
//! Structs in this module should only implement [`Serialize`], and should not
//! implement [`Deserialize`](serde::Deserialize). If anything in this module
//! implements [`Deserialize`](serde::Deserialize), it is a sign that a mistake
//! has been made.
//!
//! Any types that are children of the primary request structures should be
//! defined separately in the [`request_data`](crate::services::proton::request_data)
//! module, or in the [`common`](crate::services::proton::common) module if they
//! used by both requests and responses.
//!
