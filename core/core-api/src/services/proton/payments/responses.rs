//! Response structures for the Proton Core API.
//!
//! This module provides structures that are used to receive responses from the
//! Proton API. These structures are used to define the response bodies that are
//! received from the API when making a request.
//!
//! The purpose of the API service is to provide not only the means to make
//! requests, but also a formalisation of the data that is sent and received. To
//! this end, the structs in this module should mirror the API endpoint response
//! definitions, and NOT have any business logic or other functionality.
//!
//! To be clear, they should only contain data, and not methods; should not be
//! saved in the database; and should not be used for anything except providing
//! an interface for incoming data.
//!
//! Structs in this module should only implement [`Deserialize`], and should not
//! implement [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize). If anything in this module
//! implements [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize), it is a sign that a mistake has
//! been made. The exception here is for testing purposes, e.g. when mocking
//! response data — in which case implementing [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize)
//! conditionally, only in test mode, is advised.
//!
//! Any types that are children of the primary response structures should be
//! defined separately in the [`response_data`](crate::services::proton::response_data)
//! module, or in the [`common`](crate::services::proton::common) module if they
//! are used by both requests and responses.
//!
